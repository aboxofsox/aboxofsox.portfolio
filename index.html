            <about-body->
                <p>I've been doing web work since I was in high school. In the beginning, it was mostly just fun work, doing things out of pure curiosity. I first got into web development in our EAST <small>(Environmental and Spacial Technology)</small> class using Adobe Dreamweaver. After I graduated high school, I purused a degree in Business Administration thinking that I could land a sweet job doing something I had no business doing. I was out of place. I then changed my degree path to Information Systems <small>(IT with an emphasis in programming)</small>. There, I rekindled my passion for technology. Though, I had stepped away from web development until I joined PBL in 2013 as the Director of Marketing where I developed and maintained the public PBL website used to help new members sign up for our organzation and spread news about what was going on. Today, I work full-time in IT for Cherokee Nation Businesses. In my free time, I do freelance web work for various people and businesses.</p>
